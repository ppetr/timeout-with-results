# timeout-with-results

A Haskell library that allows timeouting a computation while allowing it to
return partial results.  Useful for making AI-like algorithms that should
return the best result found within a time limit.

## Example

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE FlexibleContexts #-}
import Control.Monad
import Control.Seq
import System.Timeout.Returning

fac :: Integer -> Integer
fac 0 = 1
fac n = n * fac (n - 1)

-- | Loop forever, computing factorials for increasing 'n'.
longComp :: MonadTimeout String m => m ()
longComp = let loop n = tell (show $ fac n) >> loop (n + 1)
           in loop 0

-- | Print the largest factorial we were able to compute in 10ms.
main :: IO ()
main = timeoutVal rseq 10000 longComp >>= print
```
